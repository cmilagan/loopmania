Questions that need addressing:
- What are the battle and support (if applicable) radii values for each enemy?
- Do characters and enemies keep moving in battle?
- How strong are allied soldiers compared to the enemies?
- What are the actual values of damage/defence for each entity? E.g., damage of sword? defence of shield? zombie damage?

- Should items have a health level and damage stats?
